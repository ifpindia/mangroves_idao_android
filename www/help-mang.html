            <p><b>User interface</b></p>
            <p>Main interface</p>
            <p>When you launch the software, Mangroves opens a new window</p>
            <div align="center"><img src="img/home.jpg" style="height:200px"></div>
            <p>This window includes :</p>
           <ol>
            <li>  A tool bar</li>
            <li>  A graphical vew, which corresponds to the graphical interface of identification</li>
            <li>  A status bar is displayed showing the number of species in the database</li>

            </ol>

            <p>The database of " Mangroves " includes 50 species at the start of the identification process. This number is displayed in the top left corner of the window. To identify one of these species, the user must inform the software with botanical characters present in the sample and which seem most relevant to distinguish this species from other.</p>

            <p>Examine the sample to find botanical character. To access the different modalities of character, move the mouse over the sketch or the buttons on the right until you reach the part of the pattern corresponding to the selected character. When moving the mouse over a hotspot, an information box specifies the character concerned. </p>
            <p><i>Note that only the colored parts of the sketch are interactive. Shaded areas remain inactive</i></p>
            <p><b>The identification process</b></p> 
            <p>Although it is possible to start with any character on this sketch, there is a particularly appropriate method for selecting the most relevant characters.</p>
            <p> Consider the characters in the following order:
            <ol>
            <li>  The leaf and its venation</li>
            <li>  The phyllotaxy </li>
            <li>  The bark</li>
            <li>  The latex and the stem section</li>

            </ol></p>
            <p> Choose a small number of characters for which your information is accurate rather than a large number of imprecise characters. Remember that the quality of the identification depends on the quality of your sample observation.</p>

            <p><b><h4>Example</h4></b> </p>

            <p> First select plant habit by clicking the frame located on the stem or on the button at the top right of the toolbar. A new window opens showing the various habit types.</p>

            <div align="center"><img src="img/port.jpg" style="height:200px"></div>

            <p>Select the habit for your plant by clicking on the corresponding drawing. </p>
            <p>You return to the portrait robot window with:</p>

              <div align="center"><img src="img/redrawdef.jpg" style="height:200px"></div>

            <ol>
                  <li>  The type of habit selected is displayed on the sketch</li>
            <li>  The number of species with this mode of character (port type) is displayed in the bottom right of the window.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>During the identification process it is important to consider the values that appear in this frame. They indicate:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>  The number of species with the character or combination of characters filled</li>
                <li>  The percentage of maximum similarity between species and the sketch done. When this percentage is less than 100%, it means that the combination of characters do not exactly match with a species of database. </li>
            </ol>
            

            <p>It is possible at any time, to access the list of results by clicking on the "Results", regardless of the number of species mentioned and the percentage of similarity. However, it is preferable to continue the identification process as the number of species mentioned remains above 10.</p>

            <p>Continued identification</p>
            
            <p>You can continue the identification by completing on the character leaf type. Click on a leaf of the portrait robot. A new window opens, showing the main types of leaves. Select the correct modality.</p>
            
             <div align="center"><img src="img/leaf.jpg" style="height:200px"></div>


            <p>The sketch is updated and now showing the habit type and the leaf type of the plant being identified.</p>

              <div align="center"><img src="img/habitatleaf.jpg" style="height:200px"></div>


            <p>Now click on the inflorescence character. A new window will open showing the different types of inflorescences. Select the one that matches your sample.</p>

             <div align="center"><img src="img/infloroscense.jpg" style="height:200px"></div>

            <p>The sketch is updated and the species counter equal to the combination of filled characters and their maximum percentage of similarity.</p>
             <div align="center"><img src="img/infloupdate.jpg" style="height:200px"></div>


            <p>Throughout the process of identification and construction of sketch, watch the number of selected species and their percentage of similarity. </p>
            <p>When this counter indicates one species at 100%, the identification system came to an end. Click on "Results" in the toolbar. You get the list of species sorted by percentage of similarity with the combination of characters filled.</p>

            <p>It is not necessary to achieve one species to 100% to see the results. When there are few species (&ls; 10) it can be faster and more efficient to compare species data sheets from the list of results.</p>

            <p><b>The button « Research »</b></p>
            <p>If you can not identify your plant sample or if you do not know what character to choose, you can ask the software to choose the most relevant character. To do this click on the "Search" button in the toolbar.</p>
            <p>Depending on the species group already selected by the first character filled, the software will offer you the most relevant character. A new window opens, offering different modalities of character.</p>
            <p>If you can answer, select the mode corresponding to the sample.</p>
            <p>If you can not answer (indecision, the sample character missing) click the "Next" button and the software will offer you another character to learn.</p>

            <p><b>Important</b></p>
            <ol>
            <li>       To change the state of a character previously entered, click on the character, select and validate the new modality. The sketch will be updated without changing other characters filled. Calculations on species will also be updated.</li>
            <li>  You can also delete a character already filled. Click on the character, click on the selected modality with a blue check, the blue check mark disappears. The new sketch is displayed without the character.</li>
            <li>  This tool allows the identification of plants from characters that you choose or the software chooses. It is not necessary to fill all available characters. The combination of some relevant characters is generally sufficient to quickly identify a plant.</li>
            <li>  Some characters are specific to some species and provide a quick access to a small selection of species (eg yellow latex).</li>
            <li> Some characters are not directly accessible from the initial sketch. They depend on a character to be informed beforehand. This is particularly the case of character "type of hair from the upper face" that is only accessible when the character "hair of the upper face of blade" is filled.</li>
            <li> At any stage of the identification process it is possible to obtain the status of results by clicking on the "Results".</li>
            </ol>

            <p><b>Direct access to the species list</b></p>

            <p>The main menu provides direct access to the list of species (regardless of the identification system) according to different modes of classification. Click on "List of Species".</p> 
            <p> You get two lists:
                  <ol>
                      <li>  One sorted by families alphabetical ordered and then by scientific names within the families</li>

            </p>

            
            <p><b>Limits of this kind of tool</b></p>

            <p>This tool uses characters of identification corresponding to different elements of the plants, vegetative or sexual. These characters are easily accessible from samples of most weeds found in rice crops in the area of the project. They are known to be relatively stable, but may be a polymorphism based on the environment or the stage of development of the individual concerned. That is why any identification made using this method must be considered with caution. It is therefore recommended to confirm this identification by comparing the sample with a reference herbarium specimen.</p>
